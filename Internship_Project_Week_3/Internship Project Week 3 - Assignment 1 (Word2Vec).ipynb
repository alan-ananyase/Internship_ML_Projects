callback read in front of crane, kauffman and bright. at the end of march, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and were asked to read for les moonves, then-president of warner bros. television.[ ] having worked with david schwimmer in the past,[ ] the series creators wrote the character of ross with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast.[ ] cox wanted to play the role of monica because she liked the \"strong\" character, but the producers had her in mind to play rachel because of her \"cheery, upbeat energy\", which was not how they envisioned monica; after cox\\'s audition, though, kauffman agreed with cox, and she got the role.[ ][ ] when matt leblanc auditioned for joey, he put a \"different spin\" on the character.[ ] he played joey more simple-minded than intended and gave the character heart. although crane and kauffman did not want leblanc for the role at the time, they were told by the network to cast him.[ ] jennifer aniston, matthew perry and lisa kudrow were cast based on their auditions.[ ] more changes occurred to the series\\'s storylines during the casting process. the writers found that they had to adjust the characters they had written to suit the actors, and the discovery process of the characters occurred throughout the first season. kauffman acknowledged that joey\\'s character became \"this whole new being\", and that \"it wasn\\'t until we did the first thanksgiving episode that we realized how much fun monica\\'s neuroses are.\"[ ] writing in the weeks after nbc\\'s pick up of friends, crane, kauffman and bright reviewed sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series, mainly unproduced seinfeld episodes.[ ] kauffman and crane hired a team of seven young writers because \"when you\\'re , you can\\'t do it anymore. the networks and studios are looking for young people coming in out of college.\"[ ] the creators felt that using six equal characters, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for \"myriad storylines and give the show legs.\"[ ] the majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers, although the actors added ideas.[ ] although the writers originally planned the big love story to be between joey and monica, the idea of a romantic interest between ross and rachel emerged during the period when kauffman and crane wrote the pilot script.[ ] during the production of the pilot, nbc requested that the script be changed to feature one dominant storyline and several minor ones, but the writers refused, wanting to keep three storylines of equal weight.[ ] nbc also wanted the writers to include an older character to balance out the young ones. crane and kauffman were forced to comply and wrote a draft of an early episode that featured \"pat the cop.\" who would be used to provide advice to the other characters. crane found the storyline to be terrible, and kauffman joked, \"you know the kids [sic] book, pat the bunny? we had pat the cop.\" nbc eventually relented and dropped the idea.[ ] each summer, the producers would outline the storylines for the subsequent season.[ ] before an episode went into production, kauffman and crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign.[ ] the hardest episodes to write were always \"the first one and the last one of each season.\"[ ] unlike other storylines, the idea for a relationship between joey and rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. the creators did not want ross and rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested joey\\'s romantic interest in rachel. the storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season\\'s finale. for the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to rachel\\'s baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none.[ ] crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. kauffman and crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.[ ] the episode title formatâ€”\"the one ...\"[ ]â€”was created when the producers realized that the episode titles would not be featured in the opening credits, and therefore would be unknown to most of the audience. episode titles officially begin with \"the one ...\" except the title of the pilot episode and the series finale \"the last one.\" filming the greenwich village building, bedford street, used as the friends\\' apartment block in establishing shots the first season was shot on stage at warner bros. studios in burbank, california.[ ] nbc executives had worried that the coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner, but, eventually consented to the coffee house concept.[ ] the opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the warner bros. ranch at : am, while it was particularly cold for a burbank morning.[ ] at the beginning of the second season, production moved to the larger stage , which was renamed \"the friends stage\" after the series finale.[ ] filming for the series began during the summer of in front of a live audience, who were given a summary of the series to familiarize themselves with the six main characters;[ ] a hired comedian entertained the studio audience between takes.[ ] each -minute episode took six hours to filmâ€”twice the length of most sitcom tapingsâ€”mainly due to the several retakes and rewrites of the script.[ ] although the producers always wanted to find the right stories to take advantage of being on location, friends was never shot in new york. bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny, even when shooting on the lot outside, and that the live audience was an integral part of the series.[ ] when the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting new york, with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments, bright noted that the set had to be big enough for the cameras, lighting, and \"for the audience to be able to see what\\'s going on\";[ ] the apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the funny scripts.[ ] the fourth-season finale was shot on location in london because the producers were aware of the series\\'s popularity in the uk.[ ] the scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences each made up of people. these were the show\\'s largest audiences throughout its run. the fifth-season finale, set in las vegas, was filmed at warner bros. studios, although bright met people who thought it was filmed on location.[ ] series finale main article: the last one (friends) the cast became very emotional while filming the final episode. jennifer aniston explained, \"we\\'re like very delicate china right now, and we\\'re speeding toward a brick wall.\"[ ] the series\\'s creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in january , four months before its original airing. crane, kauffman and bright watched the finales of other sitcoms to prepare the episode\\'s outline, paying attention to what worked and what did not. they liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of the mary tyler moore show as the gold standard. crane, kauffman, and bright had difficulty writing the finale. they did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\"[ ] the most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience, and with a minimum number of crew members. the main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly:[ ] it\\'s exactly what i had hoped. we all end up with a sense of a new beginning and the audience has a sense that it\\'s a new chapter in the lives of all these characters. â€”â€‰david schwimmer on the series finale.[ ] nbc heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype.[ ] local nbc affiliates organized viewing parties around the u.s., including an event at universal citywalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor astrovision screen.[ ] the finale was the subject of two episodes of dateline nbc, one of which ran for two hours. a one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before to the airing of the episode. following the finale, the tonight show with jay leno was filmed on the set of the friends\\'

watched by , . and . million viewers. the retrospective episode was watched by fewer than million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television broadcast of the year in the united states, only behind the super bowl.[ ] following the finales of friends and frasier, media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre. expressed opinions varied between a signalling of the end of the sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre,[ ] and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows.[ ] reception critical reception early reviews of the series were mixed; the first season holds a metacritic score of out of , based on sampled reviews, indicating \"mixed to average reviews.\"[ ] tom feran of the plain dealer wrote that the series traded \"vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of seinfeld\",[ ] while ann hodges of the houston chronicle called it \"the new seinfeld wannabe, but it will never be as funny as seinfeld.\"[ ] in the los angeles daily news, ray richmond named the series as \"one of the brighter comedies of the new season\",[ ] and the los angeles times called it \"flat-out the best comedy series of the new season.\"[ ] the chicago sun-times\\' ginny holbert found joey and rachel\\'s characteristics to be underdeveloped,[ ] while richmond commended the cast as a \"likeable, youth ensemble\" with \"good chemistry.\"[ ] robert bianco of usa today was complimentary of schwimmer, calling him \"terrific.\" he also praised the female leads, but was concerned that perry\\'s role as chandler was \"undefined\" and that leblanc was \"relying too much on the same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it.\"[ ] the authors of friends like us: the unofficial guide to friends thought that the cast was \"trying just a little too hard\", in particular, perry and schwimmer.[ ] as the series progressed, reviews became more positive, and friends became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time. it is now often ranked among the all-time best tv shows.[ ][ ][ ] critics commended the series for having consistently sharp writing and for the chemistry between the main actors.[ ] noel holston of newsday, who had dismissed the pilot as a \"so-so seinfeld wannabe\" in , repudiated his earlier review after rewatching the episode and felt like writing an apology to the writers.[ ] heather havrilesky of salon.com thought that the series \"hit its stride\" in the second season. havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations \"could reliably make you laugh out loud a few times each episode\", and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be \"original and innovative.\"[ ] bill carter of the new york times called the eighth season a \"truly stunning comeback.\" carter found that by \"generating new hot storylines and high-decibel laughs\", the series made its way \"back into the hearts of its fans.\"[ ] however, liane bonin of entertainment weekly felt that the direction of the ninth season was a \"disappointing buzzkill\", criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory. although disappointed with the season, bonin noted that \"the writing [was] still sharp.\"[ ] havrilesky thought that the tenth season was \"alarmingly awful, far worse than you would ever imagine a show that was once so good could be.\"[ ] friends was featured on time\\'s list of \"the best tv shows of all-time\", saying, \"the well-hidden secret of this show was that it called itself friends, and was really about family.\"[ ] reviews of the series finale were mixed. usa today\\'s robert bianco described the finale as entertaining and satisfying and praised it for deftly mixing emotion and humor while highlighting each of the stars.[ ] sarah rodman of the boston herald praised aniston and schwimmer for their acting, but felt that their characters\\' reunion was \"a bit too neat, even if it was what most of the show\\'s legions of fans wanted.\"[ ] roger catlin of the hartford courant felt that newcomers to the series would be \"surprised at how laughless the affair could be, and how nearly every strained gag depends on the sheer stupidity of its characters.\"[ ] ken parish perkins, writing for fort worth star-telegram, pointed out that the finale was \"more touching than comical, more satisfying in terms of closure than knee-slappingly funny.\"[ ] it may have been impossible for any one episode to live up to the hype and expectations built up around the friends finale, but this hour probably came as close as fans could have reasonably hoped. ultimately, the two-hour package did exactly what it was supposed to do. it wrapped up the story while reminding us why we liked the show and will miss it. â€”â€‰robert bianco of usa today on the series finale.[ ] awards main article: list of awards and nominations received by friends to maintain the
