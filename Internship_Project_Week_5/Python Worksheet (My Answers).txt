PYTHON WORKSHEET 2

1. Which of the following is not a core datatype in python?
	struct

2. Which of the following is an invalid variable name in python?
	1_no
3. Which one of the following is a keyword in python?
	in

4. In which of the following manner are the operators of the same precedence executed in python?
	None of these

5. Arrange the following in decreasing order of the precedence when they appear in an expression in python?
i) Multiplication ii) Division iii) Exponential iv) Parentheses
	iv – iii – ii – i

6. (28//6)**3/3%3 = ?
	0.3333…

7. Which of the following is not equal to x16 ?
	x^16

8. a = input(“Enter an integer”). What will be the data type of a?
	str

9. Which of the following statements are correct?
	Python’s operators’ precedence is based on PEDMAS
	In case of operators’ having same precedence, the one on the left side is executed first.

10. Which of the following is(are) valid statement(s) in python?
	a,b,c = 1000, 2000, 3000

11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.
	Lists - enclosed in brackets [], have any type of objects and are mutable
	Tuple - enclosed in parenthesis (), have any type of objects and are immutable
	Set - enclosed in parenthesis and brackets ([]), have unique values, is a built-in function and are mutable
	Dictionary - enclosed in curly brackets {}, have keys and values, and are mutable

12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’ with space in python.
	No. Although we can access any character using slicing, we cannot change any character.
	"I+Love+Python".replace("+", " ") # code also mentioned in Jupyter Notebook

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting the datatype of a variable in python.
	ord() returns the Unicode code point for a one-character string.
	Example:
	ord("#") >> 35
	ord("a") >> 97
	ord("1") >> 49
	
	def data_type(variable): # code also mentioned in Jupyter Notebook
    	    return type(variable)
	data_type({1:2})

14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form 𝑎𝑥2+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0. Where a, b and c are to be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be equal to 0.

15. Write a python program to find the sum of first ‘n’ natural numbers without using any loop. Ask user to input the value of ‘n’.
